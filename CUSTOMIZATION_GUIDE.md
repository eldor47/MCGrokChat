# GrokChat Customization Guide

This guide explains how to customize Grok's behavior and personality for your Minecraft server.

## üé® System Prompt Customization

The system prompt is the most powerful way to customize Grok's behavior. It tells Grok who they are, how to respond, and what style to use.

### Configuration Location

Edit `plugins/GrokChat/config.yml`:

```yaml
advanced:
  system-prompt: "Your custom prompt here"
```

### Available Placeholders

- `{player}` - Automatically replaced with the player's name

### How It Works

The system prompt is sent with every API request and sets the context for Grok's responses. It's like giving Grok a personality and instruction manual.

## üìä Temperature Settings

Along with the system prompt, adjust `temperature` for different response styles:

- `0.7 - 0.9`: Creative, varied, interesting (recommended)
- `1.0 - 1.5`: Very creative, unpredictable

**Recommendations:**

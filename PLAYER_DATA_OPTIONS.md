## 📋 Recommended Priority List

### **High Priority** (Most Useful)
1. ✅ **Experience Level** - Very useful for enchantment/XP advice
2. ✅ **Held Item** - Context-aware repair/crafting suggestions
3. ✅ **Equipment** - Tailored enchantment advice
4. ✅ **Game Mode** - Mode-specific tips

### **Medium Priority** (Situationally Useful)
5. ✅ **Status Effects** - Safety-aware advice
6. ✅ **Time of Day** - Time-aware suggestions
7. ✅ **Weather** - Weather-aware safety tips

### **Lower Priority** (Nice to Have)
8. ✅ **Nearby Entities** - Situational awareness (privacy consideration)
9. ✅ **Inventory Summary** - Crafting suggestions (may be verbose)
10. ✅ **Server Difficulty** - Difficulty-aware advice

### **Plugin-Dependent** (Requires Integration)
11. ✅ **Economy** - Shopping advice (requires Vault)
12. ✅ **Team/Faction** - Team-based advice (requires plugin)
13. ✅ **Village/Structures** - Exploration guidance (computationally expensive)

## 🎯 Example: Full Player Data Context

If we implemented all high-priority options, the context might look like:

```
Player context:
- Position: 123.45, 64.00, -789.12 (Y-level: 64)
- Biome: plains
- Dimension: Overworld
- Health: 17.5/20 hearts
- Hunger: 18/20 (saturation: 12.5)
- Experience: Level 25 (1500/3000 XP)
- Game Mode: Survival
- Held Item: Diamond Sword (Durability: 85%)
- Equipment: Netherite Helmet, Chestplate, Leggings, Boots
- Status Effects: Speed II (3:45 remaining), Fire Resistance (5:20 remaining)
- Time: Day (12:00)
- Weather: Clear
```

This would give Grok incredibly rich context for personalized advice!

---

## 💡 Implementation Considerations

### **Privacy Concerns**
- Some data (nearby players, permissions) may be sensitive
- Best to keep everything configurable per data type
- Default to privacy-first (disabled)

### **Performance**
- Gathering data should be fast (< 10ms)
- Avoid expensive operations (structure detection, nearby entity scanning)
- Cache when possible

### **Token Usage**
- More data = more tokens per request
- Each additional field adds ~20-50 tokens
- Balance usefulness vs cost

### **User Experience**
- Too much data might confuse Grok
- Prioritize most useful data
- Make it optional and granular

---

## 🚀 Suggested Next Steps

If implementing additional data:

1. **Start with Experience Level** - Most useful, simple to implement
2. **Add Held Item** - Very contextual, easy to get
3. **Add Equipment** - Complements held item well
4. **Add Game Mode** - Simple boolean, mode-specific advice
5. **Add Status Effects** - Safety-aware, moderately useful

These 5 would give Grok excellent context without being overwhelming!

## 📝 Configuration Example

```yaml
player-data:
  enabled: true
  
  # Basic (already implemented)

  include-biome: true
  include-world: true
  include-health: true
  
  # Recommended additions
  include-experience: true
  include-held-item: true
  include-equipment: true
  include-gamemode: true
  include-effects: true
  
  # Optional additions
  include-time: false
  include-weather: false
  include-nearby: false  # Privacy consideration
  include-inventory: false  # May be verbose
  
  # Plugin integration
  include-economy: false  # Requires Vault
  include-team: false  # Requires plugin
  
  use-in-auto-response: false
  use-in-direct-mention: true
```

---

**Summary:** There are many useful data points we could add! The most impactful would be **Experience Level**, **Held Item**, **Equipment**, **Game Mode**, and **Status Effects**. These provide rich context without being too verbose or privacy-invasive.

## Customizing Your Config

Feel free to mix and match settings from different examples! For instance:

**Balanced Configuration:**

- Cooldown: 10s (balanced)
- Max tokens: 400 (reasonable)
- Temperature: 0.7 (standard)

**VIP-Only Configuration:**
- Rate limit: 30/hour
- Cooldown: 5s
- Max tokens: 600
- Only give `grokchat.use` permission to VIP group

## Cost Estimation

Based on xAI's pricing (check current rates at [x.ai/api](https://x.ai/api)):

### Cost-Optimized Config
- ~200 tokens per request
- If 50 players √ó 5 requests = 250 requests/day
- Estimated: ~$X.XX per day

### Premium Config
- ~1000 tokens per request
- If 50 players √ó 50 requests = 2,500 requests/day
- Estimated: ~$XX.XX per day

**Note:** These are rough estimates. Monitor your actual usage in the xAI console.

## üéØ Real-World Examples

### Example 1: XP-Aware Enchantment Advice
```
Player (Level 25): "@grok what enchants should I get?"

Player Context:
- Experience: Level 25 (45% to next level)
- Held Item: Diamond Sword (Durability: 85%)
- Equipment: Full Netherite Armor

[Grok] At level 25, you can access level 30 enchantments! Since you're holding 
a diamond sword, prioritize Sharpness V, Sweeping Edge III, and Unbreaking III. 
For your netherite armor, get Protection IV on all pieces. You're 45% to level 26, 
so you'll have enough XP soon for those top-tier enchants!
```

### Example 2: Equipment-Aware Repair Advice
```
Player (85% durability sword): "@grok how do I repair this?"

Player Context:
- Held Item: Diamond Sword (Durability: 85%)
- Game Mode: Survival

[Grok] Your diamond sword is at 85% durability. In Survival mode, repair it at 
an anvil with another diamond sword or diamonds. Better yet, enchant it with 
Mending so it repairs automatically from XP! Since you're in Survival, save 
your diamonds - use Mending if possible.
```

### Example 3: Effect-Aware Safety Advice
```
Player (has Fire Resistance, in Nether): "@grok can I swim through lava?"

Player Context:
- Dimension: Nether
- Status Effects: Fire Resistance (5m 20s)
- Health: 18/20 hearts

[Grok] Yes! With Fire Resistance active for 5 more minutes, you can safely 
swim through lava in the Nether. Just watch out for magma blocks - they still 
do damage even with Fire Resistance! Also, be careful of ghasts shooting at you 
while you're in lava.
```

### Example 4: Mode-Specific Building Tips
```
Player (Creative mode): "@grok fastest way to build a castle?"

Player Context:
- Game Mode: Creative
- Position: 100, 64, 200

[Grok] In Creative mode, use /fill commands for large structures! For your castle 
at coordinates (100, 64, 200), try:
- /fill 100 64 200 150 80 250 minecraft:stone_bricks for walls
- Hold middle-click to copy blocks
- Use Ctrl+Q to drop entire stacks
- WorldEdit plugin would make this even faster!
```

### Example 5: Location + Item + XP Context
```
Player (@ Y-59, Level 30, holding Iron Pickaxe): "@grok best mining strategy?"

Player Context:
- Position: 123, -59, 456 (Y-level: -59)
- Experience: Level 30
- Held Item: Iron Pickaxe (Durability: 92%)

[Grok] Perfect! You're at Y-level -59, which is the best spot for diamonds! 
Since you have an iron pickaxe at 92% durability, you're ready to mine. At level 30, 
you can enchant with Fortune III for better diamond drops. Try branch mining with 
2-block spacing. Your iron pickaxe will break diamond ore, but consider upgrading 
to diamond for better efficiency!
```

## üîê Privacy Considerations

### What Data is Shared?
- ‚úÖ Position coordinates
- ‚úÖ Current biome
- ‚úÖ Dimension name
- ‚úÖ Health/hunger levels
- ‚úÖ XP level and progress
- ‚úÖ Held item name and durability
- ‚úÖ Armor pieces

### Not Shared
- ‚ùå Full inventory contents
- ‚ùå Player balance/money
- ‚ùå Other players' locations
- ‚ùå Server IP/details
- ‚ùå Private messages
- ‚ùå Command history

### Privacy Controls
1. **Master Switch:** `enabled: false` disables everything
2. **Per-Type Control:** Disable individual data types
3. **Per-Mode Control:** Use only for direct mentions, not auto-response
4. **Disabled by Default:** Privacy-first approach

---

## üéì Best Practices

### ‚úÖ DO
- Enable only what you need
- Use for direct mentions (`@grok`) by default
- Start with basic data (position, biome, world)
- Add advanced data (XP, items, effects) if helpful
- Monitor token usage and adjust

### ‚ùå DON'T
- Enable everything unless you have budget
- Use in auto-response unless players know data is shared
- Enable sensitive data without informing players
- Forget to configure per-type settings
- Overlook privacy implications

# ü§ñ Auto-Response Feature Guide

## Overview

The **Auto-Response** feature makes Grok feel like a real member of your Minecraft community! Instead of requiring players to use `@grok`, they can mention Grok naturally in conversation, and Grok will respond publicly to everyone.

**Status:** ‚úÖ Enabled by default

---

## How It Works

### Two Response Modes

#### 1. Direct Mention (`@grok`) - Private
```
Player: "@grok how do I craft a beacon?"
[Grok] (private to player) To craft a beacon, you need 3 obsidian, 5 glass, and 1 nether star...
```
- ‚úâÔ∏è Response sent **only to the player**
- üí≠ Shows "thinking" message
- üîí Private interaction

#### 2. Auto-Response (keywords) - Public
```
Player1: "I'm stuck on this build"
Player2: "hey grok any building tips?"
[Grok] (broadcast) Sure! Start with a solid foundation, use contrasting blocks for depth...
Player1: "oh that's helpful!"
Player3: "thanks grok!"
```
- üì¢ Response **broadcast to everyone online**
- üé≠ Feels like Grok is part of the conversation
- üë• Community feature

---

## Configuration

### Basic Setup (config.yml)

```yaml
chat:
  enable-auto-response: true  # ON by default
  
  auto-response-keywords:
    - "grok"
    - "hey grok"
    - "yo grok"
  
  auto-response-min-words: 3  # Minimum words to trigger
```

### Configuration Options

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `enable-auto-response` | boolean | `true` | Enable/disable auto-response |
| `auto-response-keywords` | list | `["grok", "hey grok", "yo grok"]` | Trigger words (case-insensitive) |
| `auto-response-min-words` | integer | `3` | Minimum words required in message |

---

## Examples

### Example 1: Natural Conversation
```
Player: "does anyone know where diamonds spawn?"
Player: "hey grok where are diamonds?"
[Grok] Diamonds spawn best between Y-levels -64 and -59. Branch mining at Y-59 is most efficient!
```

### Example 2: Quick Question
```
Player: "grok what's the best armor?"
[Grok] Full netherite armor with Protection IV is the best overall defense in the game!
```

### Example 3: Too Short (Ignored)
```
Player: "grok lol"  (only 2 words)
[Grok] (no response - below minimum word count)
```

### Example 4: No Keyword (Ignored)
```
Player: "how do I make a farm?"  (no keyword)
[Grok] (no response - keyword not detected)
```

## Comparison: @mention vs Auto-Response

| Feature | @grok (Direct) | Auto-Response |
|---------|----------------|---------------|
| **Who sees response?** | Player only | Everyone |
| **Thinking message?** | Yes | No |
| **Message processed** | Without @grok | Full message |
| **Use case** | Private queries | Community help |
| **Feels like** | Direct question | Natural chat |
| **Example** | `@grok help` | `hey grok help` |

---

## Why Two Modes?

### Direct Mention (`@grok`)
**Use when:**
- Player wants private help
- Question might be embarrassing
- Testing commands/features
- Admin queries

**Example scenarios:**
- "I forgot how to craft a chest" (private)
- "@grok am I in the right biome?" (private)
- "@grok test" (testing)

### Auto-Response
**Use when:**
- Community conversation
- Helping multiple players
- Making Grok feel present
- Creating engaging environment

**Example scenarios:**
- Natural chat flow
- Multiple players benefit
- Community knowledge sharing
- Making Grok feel like a member

---

## Configuration Recipes

### 1. Disable Auto-Response (Private Only)
```yaml
chat:
  enable-auto-response: false
```
Only `@grok` will work. Good for:
- Serious/competitive servers
- Cost control
- Private-only interactions

---

### 2. Strict Mode (Reduce Triggers)
```yaml
chat:
  enable-auto-response: true
  auto-response-keywords:
    - "hey grok"
    - "grok please"
  auto-response-min-words: 5
```
Requires explicit phrases and longer messages.

---

### 3. Friendly Mode (More Triggers)
```yaml
chat:
  enable-auto-response: true
  auto-response-keywords:
    - "grok"
    - "hey grok"
    - "yo grok"
    - "grok help"
    - "ask grok"
    - "grok question"
  auto-response-min-words: 3
```
More ways to trigger, better for community servers.

---

### 4. Roleplay Server (Custom Name)
```yaml
chat:
  enable-auto-response: true
  auto-response-keywords:
    - "merlin"
    - "hey merlin"
    - "wizard"
  auto-response-min-words: 3

advanced:
  system-prompt: "You are Merlin the Wise. Respond when addressed as Merlin or wizard. Call {player} 'young apprentice'."
```
Players talk to "Merlin" instead of "Grok"!

---

### 5. Cost-Optimized (Minimal Triggers)
```yaml
chat:
  enable-auto-response: true
  auto-response-keywords:
    - "grok"
  auto-response-min-words: 6
  
rate-limit:
  max-requests-per-hour: 10
```
Reduces API usage significantly.

## Best Practices

### ‚úÖ DO

1. **Start with default settings** - They're well-balanced
2. **Monitor first week** - See how players use it
3. **Adjust min-words** - If getting too many/few triggers
4. **Match server theme** - Customize keywords for roleplay
5. **Enable debug temporarily** - To see what's triggering
6. **Educate players** - Explain the two modes

### ‚ùå DON'T

1. **Set min-words too low** - Results in spam/accidents
2. **Use common words** - "help" triggers too often
3. **Add too many keywords** - Increases costs
4. **Forget about costs** - Auto-response increases usage
5. **Disable without telling players** - They'll be confused

---

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: Too Many Triggers
**Solution:**
```yaml
auto-response-min-words: 5  # Increase from 3
```

### Problem: Not Triggering
**Checklist:**
- [ ] Is `enable-auto-response: true`?
- [ ] Is keyword in the list?
- [ ] Does message have enough words?
- [ ] Did you `/grokchat reload`?

### Problem: Triggering on Wrong Messages
**Example:** "That's so grok funny" (unintended)
**Solution:**
```yaml
auto-response-keywords:
  - "hey grok"  # Remove standalone "grok"
  - "yo grok"
auto-response-min-words: 4
```

### Problem: Costs Too High
**Solutions:**
1. Disable auto-response (only @grok)
2. Increase min-words to 5+
3. Reduce rate limit
4. Remove common keywords

## Technical Details

### Flow Diagram
```
Player sends chat message
    ‚Üì
Contains @grok?
    ‚îú‚îÄ YES ‚Üí Extract question ‚Üí Send to player only
    ‚îî‚îÄ NO
        ‚Üì
    Auto-response enabled?
        ‚îú‚îÄ NO ‚Üí Ignore
        ‚îî‚îÄ YES
            ‚Üì
        Has min words?
            ‚îú‚îÄ NO ‚Üí Ignore
            ‚îî‚îÄ YES
                ‚Üì
            Contains keyword?
                ‚îú‚îÄ NO ‚Üí Ignore
                ‚îî‚îÄ YES ‚Üí Send full message ‚Üí Broadcast to all
```

### Code Implementation
- Checks for `@grok` first (takes priority)
- Falls back to keyword matching
- Case-insensitive keyword detection
- Broadcasts use `server.broadcastMessage()`
- Same rate limits/cooldowns apply to both modes

## Community Impact

### Benefits
‚úÖ Makes Grok feel like a community member  
‚úÖ Helps multiple players at once  
‚úÖ Creates engaging server atmosphere  
‚úÖ Natural conversation flow  
‚úÖ Reduces barrier to asking questions  

### Considerations
‚ö†Ô∏è Increases API usage/costs  
‚ö†Ô∏è May trigger accidentally if not configured well  
‚ö†Ô∏è Can be spammy if cooldown too low  
‚ö†Ô∏è Public responses (privacy consideration)  

---

## Advanced Tips

### 1. Time-Based Keywords
Create different keywords for events:
```yaml
# During build competition
auto-response-keywords:
  - "grok build"
  - "hey grok building"
```

### 2. Role-Based Keywords
VIP players could have special keywords (requires plugin modification)

### 3. Context-Aware Prompts
```yaml
system-prompt: "You are Grok. When people ask in public chat (auto-response), be extra friendly and helpful since everyone is watching. With {player}."
```

### 4. Cooldown Strategies
- Lower cooldown for @grok (private)
- Higher cooldown for auto-response (public)
- Currently they share the same cooldown

---

## Testing Your Configuration

1. **Enable debug mode:**
```yaml
advanced:
  debug: true
```

2. **Test direct mention:**
```
@grok test
```

3. **Test auto-response:**
```
hey grok test message here
```

4. **Test too short:**
```
grok hi
```

5. **Test no keyword:**
```
how do I do this?
```

6. **Check logs:**
```
[GrokChat] player triggered Grok (auto-response): hey grok test
[GrokChat] Grok responded: Hello!
```

---

## Migration Guide

### From v0.9 (No Auto-Response)
Auto-response is **enabled by default** in v1.0. If you want old behavior:

```yaml
chat:
  enable-auto-response: false  # Disable new feature
```

### Informing Players
Example server announcement:
```
ü§ñ New Feature: Grok Auto-Response!

You can now talk to Grok naturally:
‚Ä¢ "hey grok where are diamonds?" ‚Üí Everyone sees response
‚Ä¢ "@grok where are diamonds?" ‚Üí Only you see response

Try it out! üéâ
```

---

## FAQ

**Q: Does auto-response cost more?**  
A: Potentially yes, since more messages trigger Grok. Monitor usage and adjust settings.

**Q: Can I have different cooldowns for each mode?**  
A: Not currently - feature request!

**Q: Will it trigger if I say "That's so grok"?**  
A: Yes, unless you adjust keywords. Use phrases like "hey grok" to prevent this.

**Q: Can I customize who sees auto-responses?**  
A: Not currently - broadcasts to all. Feature request!

**Q: What if two players trigger at once?**  
A: Both get processed (rate limits/cooldowns permitting).

**Q: Does it work in private messages?**  
A: No, only in public chat.

---

## Summary

The Auto-Response feature makes Grok an active community member rather than just a command bot. It's **enabled by default** because it creates a better player experience, but can be easily disabled or fine-tuned to match your server's needs.

**Key Takeaway:** You now have TWO ways to use Grok:
1. **`@grok`** - Private, explicit
2. **Natural mention** - Public, conversational

Choose what works best for your community! üöÄ
